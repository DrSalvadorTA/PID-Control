# PID Control Project

This project demonstrates a simple PID controller applied to a second-order system using a Streamlit web interface. Users can adjust controller parameters interactively and visualize both servo and regulatory responses. The application also provides basic pole placement and stability information.

## Requirements

```
pip install streamlit control
```

## Running

Execute the Streamlit app from the repository root:

```
streamlit run pid_app/streamlit_app.py
```

This will open a browser window showing widgets for tuning parameters and plotting the response.
